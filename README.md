### Hello! My name is Ben Sheridan. I am currently a Senior here at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Sports and Recreation Management. 

I am currently working on... my Digital Product Management final project. For this project, we had to create a unique website portfolio about ourself. I have been able to learn a lot through this class, and can't build on it in the future.

I'm looking to collaborate on... any projects that are involved with sports because I have a great passion for sports. 

In the future I want to... coach at the High School level. While this may seem random, I have grown up playing sports and many coaches at the High School level are teachers and I want to have a diverse background of knowledge.
